ðŸ“š Burwood Library Membership App
A Django-based web application for managing library membership registrations. This app features a professional Bootstrap-styled frontend, MVC architecture, and is setup for containerised deployment with Docker and Kubernetes.

Features
MVC Architecture:

Model: Defines the database structure (SQLite) and business logic.

View: Handles user requests and routes them to appropriate controllers.

Controller: The views in Django act as controllers by processing requests and deciding the response.

Template: Utilizes HTML templates to render dynamic content with Bootstrap styling.

SQLite Database: Data is stored in a local SQLite database, with easy interaction and management through SQLite3 Browser.

Responsive UI: The frontend is styled using Bootstrap, providing a clean and mobile-friendly design for users.

Containerization with Docker: The app is Dockerized for easy deployment, providing a consistent environment for development and production.

Kubernetes Deployment: Deployed using MicroK8s (Kubernetes) for local cloud orchestration, allowing easy scaling and management of containers.

Technologies Used
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building web applications.

Bootstrap: A popular frontend framework for building responsive and modern web interfaces.

SQLite: A lightweight relational database used for storing library membership data.

Docker: A tool for containerizing applications, ensuring consistency across environments.

Kubernetes (MicroK8s): A platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.

Python: Programming language used to build the backend of the web application.
